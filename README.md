#### Cloning
Just click "Download ZIP" on the right side of this Github page.

#### Doing
Please build your programs by writing your instructions into the `main` function in `kyrel.js`. 
When you're done with a problem, just copy-paste the entire `main` function, as well as any variables you've
declared above it, into a separate file called `solutions.txt`. Please put all solutions into a single document. It should look
like [sample_solutions.txt](./sample_solutions.txt) (but with more solutions, of course).

#### Submitting
Please submit your solutions to Schoology, uploading only your `solutions.txt` file.

#### Inspiration
Inspired by Karel, the fun-loving java-bot.
